"The toDataURL method is not supported by all types of elements, including SVGs. If you're trying to download an SVG-based QR code generated by the react-qr-code library, you might have to convert the SVG to a different format, such as PNG, before downloading. The SVG-based QR code is first converted to an image, and then drawn on a canvas. The canvas is then converted to a PNG data URL using the toDataURL method"
