# JyKsports_FrontEnd

Jyk Sports is a store where people can find and buy shoes for the family . Nowadays, they need help to coordinate all of the information about brands, size colors, or references that arrive at the stores from China. This is a web application made it in React js, Redux Toolkit and some libraries to generate a QR code because the idea in the future is to have the ability to read the QR code and show to the user the information that it is looking for .

"The toDataURL method is not supported by all types of elements, including SVGs. If you're trying to download an SVG-based QR code generated by the react-qr-code library, you might have to convert the SVG to a different format, such as PNG, before downloading. The SVG-based QR code is first converted to an image, and then drawn on a canvas. The canvas is then converted to a PNG data URL using the toDataURL method"
